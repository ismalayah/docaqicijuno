I think we heard what everybody else heard and so much of it was – I don’t know how much rumor and innuendo were involved with it. I talked to Arn, years later, about it."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I talked to Arn, years later, about it. I never talked to Sid about it, but I guess they were out in a bar overseas and Arn had a few drinks and Arn was on Sid pretty hard with ribbing on the square, which means he was kind of jokingly throwing out shoot comments that were getting under Sid’s skin. One thing led to another, led to another, and I forget who went to who’s room. I think Sid went to Arn’s room with the chair. They got into a big fight with Sid eventually pulling out some scissors and stabbing Arn several times, damn near killing him, literally damn near killing him. Both guys were separated. Arn was in the hospital for a long time. I remember <a href=#>Vince [McMahon]</a> calling Arn when he got back to the States and checking on him. Arn kind of shared the story, but Arn was even just like, ‘Hey, sh*t happens sometimes,’ but it was a black mark on Sid tremendously from use of the scissors and just a horrible, ugly, ugly incident that I don’t think either one of those guys would want to go back and point to in any shape, way, or form, other than that was an unfortunate incident.</span></p><p><span>By the time that Arn got there it was pretty much bygones be bygones; however, I don’t care who you are, I think there’s always gonna be underlying feelings when someone stabs you that many times and you realize how close to death you actually were, but then when they came over it was pretty much business and I don’t remember them ever saying anything negative about him, but I don’t know if it would even come up by the time they came over in the 2000s.</span></p><p><span>It’s just good business and also people looked Sid as the aggressor in the whole deal. Sid’s the one that went to the room and damn near killed another employee of the company. That’s just a good business decision in my thinking, but also if you’ve got all the talent saying, ‘We don’t want him here,’ it’s not gonna work. Nobody’s gonna wanna do business with him. It’s not good for him. It’s not good for anybody else. Let him go.</span></p><p><span>I heard the story from Graham and Pillman, both. Pillman much later when Pillman came to work for us several years after that, but in that very bar – in the Ramada Bar – Mike Graham told me the story of what had taken place. I’ve heard Sid’s version, but through other people – not directly from Sid. Sid’s version was that he was injured and just had this surgery done and they were all popping off to him and he popped off to them and it was two against one and he was gonna defend himself, hence the squeegee. From Mike Graham, Sid was sitting there telling them everything that was great about WWF and everything that was wrong with WCW and Graham told me he told him, ‘Just shut the f*ck up, Sid.’ They got into a little verbal thing and Pillman got into it verbally back and forth. Pillman stood up and said, ‘Let’s do something about it.’ They all got in between them. Blah blah blah. Sid left; they thought they were done with him. He came back with the squeegee and as Graham said, ‘I went up and ripped the squeegee out of his hand and told him I was gonna shove it up his ass, if he didn’t get out of there.’ That was the Mike Graham version, straight from Mike Graham’s mouth, from me sitting at that very bar at the Ramada, at the airport, not long after it happened.</span></p><p><span>Readers may listen to Something to Wrestle with Bruce Prichard in its entirety below:</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfY9uZ2ptZ2LAqrCMmqmnZZGjsaa%2B0qilZquTnsC0u9GsZKKmk56xprrT</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
