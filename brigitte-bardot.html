(I transcribed the subtitles.) Like famed producer Bruce Dickinson, Godard put his pants on one leg at a time, but once they were on he made hits:</p><p>Q: Jean-Luc Godard, with "Contempt" you're once again on everyone's lips....</p><p>G: So much the better if it helps the movie.... I wouldn't really care as long as they go to my movies. That's what's important.</p><p>Q: What do you think of reviews?</p><p>G: I think much more highly of them than most people do. It's probably because I was a critic once, and I said a lot of bad things. I was cruel and mean to a lot of people. And though my opinions haven't changed, when I read bad reviews, the important thing for me is the discussion that's taking place. Whether it's good or bad is not the issue for me....</p><p>Q: Do you believe there's such a thing as a fair review?</p><p>G: (shrugs) Yes, but criticism isn't an artistic creation. It will always be inferior. Seventy-five percent of critics are only in that line of work temporarily. That's why critics are always bitter and sad towards those they praise and those they disparage.</p><p>Q: You became a director after having been a critic. Do you think it's a step up?</p><p>G: Yes, being a critic was a good experience. It's good training.</p><p>Q: Doesn't it run the risk of stifling the imagination?</p><p>G: No. It made me love everything. It taught me not to be narrow-minded, not to ignore Renoir in favor of Billy Wilder, or something like that. I like them both, even though they are extreme opposites. [...]</p><p>Q: ... Even with all her clothes on, ["Contempt" star Brigitte Bardot is] still a gold mine. [...] Those who would like to see Miss Bardot undress in a movie made by a bad or vulgar director wouldn't dare go see it. But with you their conscience is clean because it's art --</p><p>G: Good for them. They're right. If they find her pretty, as I do, there's no --</p><p>Q: Some of your films have been failures. How does that affect you?</p><p>G: One of my films in particular, "Les Carabiniers," wasn't even a failure. It was... nothing at all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmnJmjqXqiusNmmqudp2Svs7XGoqutnV2XrrOwzq0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
