In her <a href=#>Instagram</a> caption, she told her followers that she "always collected crystals" and that her parents "thought it was weird" when she'd go looking for "rocks and crystals" in neighbors' driveways. "I have a beautiful collection now, but only about 10. I give them a lot of attention. I almost feel a sort of protection when I see rocks now. They are so strong and solid. I like holding them,"&nbsp;Spears wrote, adding that if she was ever around anyone who gave her "bad vibes" when she was younger, she would "hold [the rock] very tight."</p><p>Spears also revealed that these rocks and crystals would help her improve her confidence and admitted that she would bring them with her for interviews — even as an adult. She then went on to write that rocks "have a lot of intellect," which is rather curious because rocks aren't living beings. Nevertheless, she encouraged her fans to "hold on to one of [their] favorite rocks" when they find themselves&nbsp;wanting to connect "to the universe." Spears concluded her strange caption by reminding people that they "can't mess with Mother Nature" and that while she is powerful, she's also "responsible" for the beautiful seasons. "So please pick up a piece of her today and smile! There are so many religions but the 'worship of nature' is the only phenomenon...so go pick up a f****** rock,"&nbsp;she concluded, adding three crying with laughter emoji.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWppaIN2e8GroK2mla56tLzEmqmsZZyWwaa%2F02aroaelnLW1v4yaqZ5lpKq%2Fr7XNoGShnZGZwHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
