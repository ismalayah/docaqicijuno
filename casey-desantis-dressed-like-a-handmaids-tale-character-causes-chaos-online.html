So, the fact she went with an outfit that‚Äôs seemingly identical to those worn by the wives of the powerful men in the HBO series The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale shouldn‚Äôt be ignored, especially in the wake of her husband‚Äôs repugnant, regressive, and hateful morality crusade against teaching children about LGBTQ+ people and sexual health.</p><p data-characters=819 data-current-count=819 data-injectable=true>The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale, adapted from a Margaret Atwood book of the same name, is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a drama set in a dystopian near-future</a>, where fertility rates have collapsed as a result of environmental factors. After a brutal civil war, an ultra-religious government established a new nation named Gilead, which roughly covers the geographical United States. The government is incredibly conservative and misogynistic, not allowing women to work outside the home, own property, or even read. The few remaining women who can carry children are referred to as ‚ÄúHandmaids,‚Äù and are effectively sexual and reproductive slaves for the upper class of Gilead. The wives of these ruling men are complicit in this sexual slavery, and help to enforce the social order. These are the people whose dress DeSantis seems to be aping.</p><p data-characters=565 data-current-count=565 data-injectable=true>The irony of her outfit will not be lost on most political commentators, who have noticed the terrifying direction in which Florida is heading under her husband. Aside from his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">horrific ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Say Gay Bill,‚Äù</a> which seeks to erase any mention of LGBTQ+ people in a classroom setting, he‚Äôs also overseen one of the most regressive anti-abortion laws come into effect in the state, effectively outlawing the procedure for any pregnancy over six weeks long ‚Äî a timeframe in which many women wouldn‚Äôt have even realized they were carrying.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Characteristics of The Handmaid's Tale‚Ä¶<br>Banning books.<br>Persecuting LGBTQ.<br>Subservient wife.<br>Extremists.<br>Religious fanatics.<br>Cult.<br>Pro-life.<br>Corrupt.</p>‚Äî üü¶ Tales & Typos üüß (@kathrynresister) <a href=#>May 19, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=639 data-current-count=939 data-injectable=false>While Gilead‚Äôs public hangings and brutality have yet to be aped by Floridians, the rhetoric DeSantis espouses is certainly a building block to getting there. And, as powerful as the Yale-educated governor is, a theocratic, regressive movement needs foot soldiers to really get going, and that means women who are happy to see their rights diminished in the name of traditionalism. We perhaps shouldn‚Äôt be surprised that someone married to Ron might think that way, but we should also take it as a warning: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Florida is not a safe space for minorities</a>, and we need to be observant about the dark place it‚Äôs heading towards.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmegpLmqwMicqmibkaiyunnDnqqapqSewG6w0Z6qrJ2UYrmqt8RmmGagkaOxrq3InapmrJGhsm6vx5qpmpukmr9ur8Cuqp6rXZi1orvSZqanpJmjsnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
