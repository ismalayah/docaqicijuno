There’s an urban legend about Bale and how he could sweat on command on camera, willing little moisture beads to appear on his forehead.</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=529 data-injectable=true>That’s incredibly impressive if true, but the truth is somewhere in-between the legend and a confession from Bale. In an interview with Inverse, Bateman explained that he modeled his approach to Bateman after the source material.</p><p data-characters=152 data-current-count=152 data-injectable=false>American Psycho, the acclaimed novel by Bret Easton Ellis, came out in 1991.

Bret Easton Ellis actually described it in this scene as his breathing sort of getting stopped. And so in doing that, I just found that beads of sweat kept breaking out on my forehead. But that wasn’t actually planned. It was just a result of what I was doing with my breathing.”</p><p data-characters=170 data-current-count=170 data-injectable=false>OK anyone else think he’s being a little modest here?
