In 1983, the guitarist's mother<strong> Connie Navarro </strong>was murdered by a vengeful ex-boyfriend, when Dave was just 15 years old.</p><p>"My mother was in a relationship, the relationship ended," the Jane's Addiction founder and the former Red Hot Chili Peppers band member, 47, recalled to host <strong>Ricky Camilleri</strong>. "She wanted to go a different way, and her then-ex-boyfriend murdered her and my aunt."</p><p>He justified why he would call his mother's murder a form of domestic violence. "Sometimes it's hard to link domestic violence with murder because it's such a broad jump," Navarro reflected. "Except it is a domestically violent situation and probably the worst-case scenario in a domestically violent world."</p><p>Navarro recently connected with Law and Order: SVU actress <a href=#><strong>Mariska Hargitay</strong>,</a> who has taken the lead on the "No More" campaign against domestic violence, which features numerous celebrities in its PSA including him. "I appeared on an episode of Law and Order: SVU," Navarro said. "I've had somewhat of a connection in that word and I got asked to be a part of this. Of course, I jumped at it with my history."</p><p>He explained that his mission was to reach as many victims of domestic violence as possible. "The situation with my family was in the '80s. We didn't have PSAs like this, we didn't have the Internet," Navarro said Monday. "We didn't have have the means of communication that we have today, and we didn't have such a broad reach in terms of getting a message out. So of course I'm happy to be a part of that."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Navarro, <a href=#>who was famously married</a> to <strong><a href=#>Carmen Electra</a></strong> for three years until 2006, said his latest work includes a feature-length documentary that tells the story of his late mother. "A lot of this trauma is what we're talking about," he said of the aftermath of domestic violence. "A lot of trauma survivors have the cloud of trauma with them forever. Part of my process was to get into this traumatic event as deeply as I could."</p><p>Navarro said the coping process through his latest project has been helpful. "I don't know if there's ever a day when you're repaired," he candidly confessed. "[But] to have a deeper emotional understanding, to have a deeper psychological understanding, I definitely feel more at peace for sure."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadmaaaeq%2Bt1Zqpq6ddpL2mutJmrKllkZe8tsCMoaCsZZ2kwamx0axkpq2imbKzeZFpaG1pZWZ%2FcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
