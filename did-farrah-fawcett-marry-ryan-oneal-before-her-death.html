But despite living under the same roof for so many years and sharing a <a href=#>son, Fawcett and O'Neal</a> never got married. They almost did twice, though. The first time was an impulsive act that was seemingly halted by fate. After he proposed using a cigar band, the two decided to head to church, but a flat tire got in the way, according to <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>.&nbsp;And they left it at that.&nbsp;</p><p>Both stars had good reasons to be hesitant about marriage. Fawcett had been in a tumultuous marriage that ended in divorce, the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a> noted. O'Neal didn't have one, but two failed marriages in the books. In spite of their reservations, Fawcett and O'Neal put the option back on the table later in life. This time around, the circumstances caused many to view the news with suspicion.&nbsp;</p><p>O'Neal announced he had proposed to Fawcett in a June 2009 interview with <a href=#>ABC News</a>' "20/20," just days before <a href=#>she died</a>&nbsp;on the 25th. "I've asked her to marry me, again, and she's agreed," he told Barbara Walters. Fawcett was on her deathbed then, which O'Neal was well aware of. "We will, as soon as she can, say yes ... Maybe we can just nod her head," he joked. But his plans never came to fruition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhpbn56go6doJ1llpa%2Fs63HZp2ar5OawbV5zJqpq7Fdp8aiuoyopZ6ZnGKvprLOq5xmoJWneqWxwK2faA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
