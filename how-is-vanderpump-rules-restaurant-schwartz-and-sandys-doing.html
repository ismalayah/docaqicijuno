All of this arrived on top of the pair’s already tumultuous road to opening the restaurant, which was plagued with delays and in-fighting as the Toms fought with each other and their business partner, Greg Morris.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=166 data-current-count=544 data-injectable=true>As Vanderpump Rules prepares for its <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">season eleven premiere</a> on January 30, 2024, the question on every Bravo fan’s lips is: How is Schwartz and Sandy’s doing?</p><h2 id=h-is-business-booming data-injectable=false>Is business booming?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by @schwartzandsandys</a></p></figure><p data-characters=430 data-current-count=730 data-injectable=true>Schwartz and Sandy’s seems to have recovered from its tumultuous period, at least according to Tom Schwartz himself. The Vanderpump Rules <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">star revealed</a> that the restaurant is “coming back”, and is “doing better” after the fallout from Scandoval. While Schwartz admitted that he thought the business might have been “over” following the scandal, he and Sandoval have since committed to improving the restaurant.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>Schwartz even outlined plans for a “revamp” of the restaurant, announcing an array of new drinks, food menu items and music programs. The restaurateur’s comments align with earlier updates he provided in December 2022, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">when he said</a> that Schwartz and Sandy’s was in the process of “resetting,” and that despite the backlash, he and Sandoval were “hanging in there.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=690 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by @schwartzandsandys</a></p></figure><p data-characters=416 data-current-count=416 data-injectable=true>By all accounts, the restaurant is still open, with Distractify reporting that the telephone number is still operational. Reviews of Schwartz and Sandy’s have been posted by patrons as recently as last month, and the restaurant’s Instagram page has been tagged in new posts in January. However, the page itself — from which Sandoval is noticeably absent — has not uploaded a post since January of 2023.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=291 data-injectable=false>It’s not yet known whether Sandoval has returned from his hiatus from the business, which he took in October 23 following the Scandoval backlash. In any case, audiences can expect at least some updates around Schwartz and Sandy’s throughout the imminent season of Vanderpump Rules.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/vanderpump-rules-season-10-cast-reunion.png><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false>For their part, the sandwich shop set to be opened by fellow castmates (and former girlfriends) Arina Madix and Katie Maloney, is also expected to form part of Vanderpump Rules’ eleventh season.
