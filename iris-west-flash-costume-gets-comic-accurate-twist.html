Recommended Videos Yes, it’s finally happening, folks. While we’ve known for a while that Iris would be suiting up, it was only this week that our first look at her costume was revealed and the reaction to it so far has been somewhat divisive."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

For one, many are taking issue with the colors used here, with fans hoping they’d see her in a more comics-accurate outfit, something with a bit more red and yellow for instance.</p><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=342 data-injectable=false>And while we won’t be getting that on the show, digital artist extraordinaire Boss Logic has now taken to Twitter to share his design of Iris’ suit, which does hark back to the source material a lot more than The CW’s version does, bringing the classic color scheme into play and actually resulting in a pretty awesome look.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/DWsoDUqU8AEBdl3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/flash-iris-west.jpeg><p data-characters=456 data-current-count=798 data-injectable=true>Cool, eh? Of course, the colors chosen for the show were very likely on purpose. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">As some have already pointed out</a>,&nbsp;the costume has its design in common with the outfits worn by two female speedsters from the comics. For one, Dawn Allen, Barry and Iris’ daughter, who inherited her dad’s abilities along with her twin Don. The second, meanwhile, is Jenni Ognats, another Allen from the far future who’s part of the Legion of Super-Heroes.</p><p data-characters=287 data-current-count=287 data-injectable=false>With that in mind, many think that the purple and white superhero suit might just be foreshadowing the real identity of Jessica Parker Kennedy’s mystery character who keeps turning up from time to time – as Dawn and Jenni are the two main suspects for who she may be playing.</p><p data-characters=168 data-current-count=455 data-injectable=false>We’ll have to wait and see if anything comes from that, but be sure to catch&nbsp;<strong>The Flash</strong>&nbsp;when it returns from a short break this Tuesday, February 27th on The CW.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqvsisZLCdo6l6p7jArJ9mm5%2Bowba5xGaenqyjYrCwucicZJqbk6q%2FosDEZquwoaOpfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
