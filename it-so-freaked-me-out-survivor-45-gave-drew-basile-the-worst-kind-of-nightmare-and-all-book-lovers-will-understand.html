While his sleep talking habits appeared to be rather harmless, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dalton Ross at Entertainment Weekly</a> asked the graduate student how often of an occurrence sleep-talking is for him, as well as what the weirdest thing he has ever done or said in his sleep is, during an exclusive exit interview.</p><p data-characters=200 data-current-count=200 data-injectable=false>Naturally, Drew sang like a bird, admitting that a recurring nightmare about his favorite bookstore back home occupied his brain during his time on the beach.

I don’t know why I would go to my favorite bookstore in the dream. It would be closed, and it so freaked me out, and it happened so many times that when I got back into America that first day, one of the first things I did was I took an Uber to go see the favorite bookstore” — how wild is that?</p><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=323 data-injectable=false>He then proceeded to explain that this recurring nightmare about his favorite bookstore back home was “perhaps a testament to the effect that Survivor can have on you.” After all, the beloved competition series has been said to take a toll on not only your physical health, but your mental health as well…</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=560 data-injectable=true>He concluded with a chuckle, “I’d been away for a month, and I was questioning the fundamental cores of my reality, my relationships —&nbsp;is my bookstore still around? So yeah, that was probably the funniest dream.”</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=301 data-injectable=false>While Drew is already greatly missed on our television screens, to find out who takes home the title of “Sole Survivor” and the million-dollar cash prize at the end of&nbsp;Survivor 45, catch the highly-anticipated finale on December 20 at 8pm ET/PT on CBS, or the following day on Paramount Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqwIyspmaeopqurLHDZqSeZZ%2BqwW6%2F1Kutoq6fp3p1gYygmK%2BdXZm%2FpsOMm5isoZyaerW0xGauqKqjqXqstc2dZKieXaO2qLTTppirnV2Wu6V5wKWjZpqfpLhuuM6vnKurXay2rbiMrqWdnaKowaK6w2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
