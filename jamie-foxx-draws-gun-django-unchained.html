It affected me. At the time, we were playing music to the whole plantation. The music was a gospel song by Fred Hammond called No Weapons Formed Against Me Shall Prosper, and just to see everybody go to a place… There were people with tears in their eyes.</p><p>Those moments, well, we can’t really tell here right now because we’re still shooting the movie. But I think those moments we put on the screen are going to jerk people. Their emotions are gonna be really running high.”</p><p data-characters=274 data-current-count=666 data-injectable=true>Sounds like Tarantino really has something special cooked up for us. But then again, when does the man ever&nbsp;disappoint? Admittedly, he hasn’t made a ton of films&nbsp;throughout&nbsp;his career but I’ve throughly enjoyed everything that he’s attached his name to.</p><p data-characters=297 data-current-count=297 data-injectable=false>Recently, we heard that there were <a title="Django Unchained Unchains Anthony LaPaglia As He Exits The Film" href=#>some troubles on set and things weren’t running too smoothly</a>, but I don’t think we have anything to be worried about. While it’s true that numerous actors have exited the production, I’m still remaining optimistic about&nbsp;<strong>Django Unchained</strong>.</p><p data-characters=188 data-current-count=485 data-injectable=true>I mean, the film still boasts names like Leonardo DiCaprio, Christoph Waltz and Samuel L.
