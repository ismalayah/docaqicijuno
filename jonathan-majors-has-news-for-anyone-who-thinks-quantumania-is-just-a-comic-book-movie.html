Recommended Videos Since then, plenty of other voices in the industry have weighed in, such as Quentin Tarantino, Dennis Villeneuve, and Seth Rogen, and more often than not, such opinions don’t paint the MCU in a particularly enviable light, and it seems that we’ve gotten to the point where the term “comic book movie” has turned into a negative distinction."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>, the outrageously talented Majors rejected the notion of comic book films being lesser than other types of movies, suggesting that there’s an artistic style to them that’s just as valid as something Shakespearean.</p><p>“I think the biggest prejudice toward the MCU films is that [some critics] say, ‘Oh, it’s a comic book movie,’ That actually really hurts your feelings, you know? As an artist, you go, ‘Well, what does that mean?’ There’s this idea that there’s a certain way you have to act in these movies and it’s not ‘real acting.’ But I’ve watched all of them, and I know it’s real acting. There’s a certain style to it, like anything: Shakespeare, Chekhov, August Wilson, Katori Hall. There’s a certain style to it, of course, but the flesh-and-blood element, the talking and listening element is extremely there.”</p><p data-characters=522 data-current-count=522 data-injectable=true>We doubt it’s going to settle the debate, but seeing a voice like Majors’ step in to dismiss such a tired conversation is nothing short of refreshing, especially when some of the MCU’s criticisms don’t exactly hold up against some scrutiny; Marvel movies may take up an egregious amount of space in the cinema (as do most all CGI-heavy blockbusters), but do we really think that those audiences would flock to something like The Irishman if this weren’t the case? We wouldn’t bet on it.</p><p data-characters=70 data-current-count=70 data-injectable=false>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania will release to theaters on Feb. 17.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooaimkam1orqMppijp6Koeqmt0malnq%2BjYrOwvoyapbKnnpp6uLTOZquhoZ6gwG691Jqlra2dlruqrYyiqmaipajBbq2MnKamoZNir7C7ymakqK6Zmnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
