Morgan captioned the shot “On the set with Keyshia Cole playing her mama Frankie.”</p><p>News about the movie spread like wildfire, and while many bloggers and social media critics weighed in on the appropriateness of Cole making the film so soon after Lons’ death, there was one Twitter statement that the “Love” chart-topper did not let slide.</p><p>“I said it! As soon as @KeyshiaCole momma died she was going to used that opportunity as she always does and make it work for her. Now she is making a movie about Frankie she always degrading them for her benefit,” one of Twitter user remarked.</p><p>Cole clapped back, “Degrading my mother. ? I wanted the best for my mom. You prefer my story not be my story? At times I have too. But my truth is my truth. I just live mine loud. (while some suffer in silence. But This will come wit all that I do, So speak YOUR TRUTH, but yours ain’t mine.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Degrading my mother. ?

All of this was documented in the singer’s revolutionary documentary “Keyshia Cole: The Way it Is,” which debuted on BET in 2006, and the show’s 2009<a href=#> spinoff</a> “Frankie and Neffe,” also featuring Cole’s half-sister Neffeteria Pugh.</p><p>In one episode Cole talked with her mother publicly about what her death would do to her, and Lons charged her to stay strong and mourn for her but move on with decisions that would be best for her.</p><p>In the clip, Cole said in the emotional conversation, “I couldn’t imagine my kids having to fend for themselves without my protection. Even though I am a grown woman you should still want to be there.”</p><p>“You’ll always have my protection as a mother, spiritually,” Lons comforted through her own tears. “And nothing can touch a mother’s love, Keyshia.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Cole asked her mother what if she is unable to find her, and Lons cut her off, saying, “Well, that devil is from the rotten pits of hell. Don’t you let him ever put that in your mind, because I’m gonna be always where you can find me. Even when God called me, a mother’s love will always protect you no matter what.”</p><p>Lons used the momentum from these shows to become an influencer and sometime radio personality, however, her addiction often blocked many of the advantages being a pioneering reality star might have offered. One of her last major television appearances was on “Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew.”</p><p>Despite constant efforts to help Lons stay sober, Lons died on July 18, 2021. At the time of her transitioning, Cole shared with fans “WORSE PAIN EVER ….. TO SEE MY MAMA IN A BODY BAG ON HER BIRTHDAY! MY HEART SO F-CKIN BROKE!”</p><p>Months after her death,<a href=#> Cole penned a deeply touching tribute</a> to her mother (that has since been deleted). She wrote, “Some people already spoke to me for the last time and they don’t even know it. Be thankful for your parents And treat your loved ones correctly.”</p><p>She concluded her reflection by saying, “No respect for people who have no respect for their parents … Have a great Monday!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX90e49qZmpuX6Cyur%2FHophmm5%2Bhsm60yK2qZpqRmLhurcWtnKtllpa7bq3CnKysnaNitaa%2BjKidZpyVnL%2BisMinnmaglad6ra3TnmSmp6SdsrN5xauYp6OZmnqjxYymmKShnpx6o7XOqaCcZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
