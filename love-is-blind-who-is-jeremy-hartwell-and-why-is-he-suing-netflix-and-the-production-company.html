Recommended Videos Hartwell appeared in the first half of the second season, known as the “pods phase,” before being eliminated and moving on to the “engagements phase.” He received noticeably less screen time than his fellow contestants, a fact he’s been open about on his Instagram account. However, leading up to the show’s premiere, he promoted the competition by saying, “Filming for Love is Blind was one of the most intense and memorable events of my life and thanks to journaling and reflection, it remains an experience that I’m at peace with, regardless of the ups and downs."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

This made cast members hungry for social connections and altered their emotions and decision-making.”</p><p data-characters=146 data-current-count=514 data-injectable=true>The lawsuit serves as “a proposed class action on behalf of all participants in ‘Love Is Blind’ and other non-scripted productions.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=546 data-current-count=546 data-injectable=true>The “inhumane working conditions” Hartwell and his legal team put forth include the below minimum-wage salary the contestants received ($1,000 weekly payments for over 20 hours of work, seven days a week, with a max of $8,000); the regular service of “alcoholic beverages, soft drinks, energy drinks, and mixers” all day, but only providing “hydrating drinks such as water” during the day. In addition, the lawsuit will look into whether the production company deprived the cast members of food, water, and sleep, as Hartwell claims.</p><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=258 data-injectable=false>A quick stroll through Hartwell’s Instagram reveals a steady stream of promotional posts for Love Is Blind and accompanying captions that give little indication of a lawsuit looming in the distance. One can only wonder if the intention was there all along.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ytu9WeZKKrXZe5qrrDZq6hp12ewG62xKucprFdna6zwNaeo6VlkaOxbsPHsmSiq12dsm6%2F1KKloGWemsGnuMixZJqmlGLBqbGMqamonKWYwaq7zWaaqKWglru6ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
