What are some other examples of foreshadowing in the MCU?</a> from <a href=#>marvelstudios</a></figure><p data-characters=490 data-current-count=490 data-injectable=true>One user sounded off without restraint, naming a plethora of hints that could very well blossom later on in the MCU. Such examples include the appearance of Aaron Davis (the civilian identity of the Spider-Man villain known as the Prowler) in Spider-Man: Homecoming, the first time we heard Doctor Strange’s name back during Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and the recent hint at a certain Canadian hero in a split-second shot of She-Hulk: Attorney at Law‘s second episode.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>KostisPat257’s comment from discussion "The MCU does a great job of leaving little nuggets. What are some other examples of foreshadowing in the MCU?"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=558 data-injectable=true>Another user went a tad more obscure, pointing out that the name of a bar in 2014’s Guardians of the Galaxy, Boot of Jemiah, shares a name with a member of the Celestials, which we wouldn’t be officially introduced to until 2021’s Eternals.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>Ccbm2208’s comment from discussion "The MCU does a great job of leaving little nuggets.

Perhaps, like most of the questions we have at the moment, will all be answered over the course of the MCU’s next decade, or so we hope.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJopJqqppq5brnEpqaroaqav7R5w6umqWWknbKqvoyfmK%2Bnop7BpnnSpaCcnV2ks26y0ZqlnKCZqLJuss6rnKygkZm8uLXNoGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
