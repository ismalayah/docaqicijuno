Unfortunately, the star's ongoing lawsuit against producer and alleged abuser Dr. Luke drained the star of her financial resources. According to <a href=#>TMZ</a>, the singer was so broke that Taylor Swift gave her $250,000 to help cover legal costs.</p><p>Kesha's lawsuit against Dr. Luke has been a long road that halted the singer's career. In 2014, she took the producer to court for "sexually, physically, verbally and emotionally abusing [her] to the point where [she] nearly lost her life." Dr. Luke countersued, and she was at an inpasse: make music with her alleged abuser while the trial continues, or don't make music at all. He even attempted to <a href=#>ban</a> her from performing at the 2016 Billboard Music Awards. Without new music and live performances, she had no steady source of income.</p><p>Though the singer's lawsuits are on-going, Kesha recently had her much-deserved comeback. She pooled her remaining funds to make her third full-length album,&nbsp;Rainbow, which Sony <a href=#>claimed</a> was entirely funded by the pop star herself. Rainbow debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and sold a whopping 90,000 albums in the U.S. during the <a href=#>first week</a>. Though Dr. Luke is probably still entitled to collect a healthy portion of its earnings, he has to do so while "Praying" soars on the charts and becomes an inspirational anthem for a new generation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamplZYB0e8yuqqKbmZa7tHnWoaZmmaKaerG7zqucq2Wkna6vediorGasmKTCqLTTaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
