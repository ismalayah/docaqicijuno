Naturally, this had fans worried for his well-being</a>.</p><p>Sami Zayn squared off against JD McDonagh on this week’s episode of Monday Night RAW. However, he would also get re-injured his elbow following a brutal assault at the hands of McDonagh after the main event of the show.</p><p>While speaking on&nbsp;the&nbsp;Out of Character&nbsp;podcast with Ryan Satin, Sami Zayn talked about the current condition of his elbow. Zayn admitted that his elbow is not doing great after RAW this week.</p><p>But I’ve been battling a lot of little nagging injuries for some time, but nothing to the extent that would put me on the shelf. So [my elbow] is part of a nagging injury that’s just kind of gotten a little bit worse after this past week’s heinous attacks by JD McDonagh, for which there will be revenge.</p><p>So maintaining your health and addressing those nagging injuries, I think that’ll become more important. But I still managed to give you a long-winded answer to a very easy question. My elbow’s alright, it’ll be okay. It’s not great, but it will be okay.”</p><p>With Kevin Owens still out of action due to a legitimate injury, it is not known what WWE will have planned for Owens and Sami Zayn as the Undisputed Tag Team Champions.
