Gomez’s most recent Instagram and TikTok uploads were in January 2022. She didn’t explain why she went off the net, but supporters thought she was coping with the sexual assault charges offline.</p><p>The TikTok was accused of sexually abusing her former companion and fellow TikToker, Jack Wright, in May 2021. The pair had known one other since high school and featured in many videos together, prompting netizens to believe they were in a relationship. They never acknowledged their connection, but in their films, they were often seen snuggling and kissing.</p><p>However, Wright’s friend Mason Rizzo openly accused Gomez of sexually abusing Wright in TikTok and Twitter tweets on May 30, 2021, which Gomez instantly denied. Following the sexual assault charges, netizens rallied against Gomez and demanded her cancellation.&nbsp;She lost hundreds of thousands of followers as her family and Wright’s family battled behind the scenes to fix the matter. And, beginning in January 2022, she ceased releasing videos, much to the delight of netizens who wanted her to be terminated.</p><h2>Will&nbsp;Sienna Mae Gomez Gonna&nbsp;Be Cancelled</h2><p>However, Gomez returned to social media on May 29, 2022, by releasing the same video on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube.&nbsp;Gomez was seen at the beach dancing and enjoying time with her pals.&nbsp;The video was accompanied by Dominic Fike’s song ‘Cancel Me,’ which addresses the cancel culture that is prevalent in today’s society.&nbsp;Although Gomez’s video and song choice might indicate anything, considering the song’s lyrics, viewers felt she was ridiculing the cancel culture.</p><p>“I’m hoping they cancel me so I can spend time with my family.” So I can take off this mask, dawg. ‘Kiss my [expletive], dawg,’ said the people. I’m hoping for a crucifixion. I’m hoping they’ll put me down. “I hope they euthanize me,” Gomez lip-synced.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Sienna-Mae-Gomez-2.jpg alt="Sienna Mae Gomez" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Most internet users were angered by her comeback, but Gomez was unconcerned and courageously kept her comments section up.</p><p>“Ain’t no way she’s back,” one person remarked, while another added, “DAMNNNN, she’s alive? And the comments are open? “You are a courageous girl.”</p><h2>Sienna Mae Gomez Receives Support for Her Return</h2><p>Gomez followed up the post with two additional TikTok videos.&nbsp;She lip-synced to a famous Nicki Minaj tagline that went “took some time off to relax, and now it’s game time” in the first video.&nbsp;Meanwhile, in the previous video, the TikToker was dancing to Vmesh Beats’ ‘Tell em x Yeah Yeah.’&nbsp;Gomez’s dance for the song went viral last year, and she has often replicated the video in new ensembles since then.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Sienna-Mae-Gomez-3.jpg alt="Sienna Mae Gomez" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>While some netizens were appalled by her comeback and chastised her for not knowing what it meant to be canceled, her devoted followers looked overjoyed.&nbsp;They replied on her Instagram post that they missed her and wondered how she was doing.&nbsp;Ashley Graham, a supermodel, commented on Gomez, saying, “Hi beautiful! We adore you.”</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Sienna Mae Gomez</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>TikToker</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqop2eo65uucCeZKCnnZrHbr7EnJyirpWoerTBz6mmq6xdm7yzeceeqWaqlanCs7qMmp2tnaJirq24jK2fnmWRobmms8CtoKimo2Kur7CMnKanrKKkw6a%2B0rJm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
