T, whose real name is Tracy Lauren Marrow, said he constantly gets asked what he wants to do next.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=653 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>People always ask me what would I like to do next…. I think its time for me to get into the MARVEL Universe or some StarWars Movies.. 💥 They always need a Villian 💥</p>— ICE T (@FINALLEVEL) <a href=#>May 10, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=274 data-current-count=274 data-injectable=false>His timing isn’t bad, considering there <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">have been rumors</a> that Marvel is looking to replace Jonathan Majors as Kang amid an ongoing domestic assault case. Unfortunately, Marrow’s track record isn’t great. Let’s talk the abomination that was <strong>Tank Girl</strong>.</p><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=611 data-injectable=true>The movie — based on a popular comic book by Jamie Hewlett and Alan Martin — seemed like a sure bet. Actress of the moment Lori Petty (Point Break) played the titular character, but they styled her like Gwen Stefani and made her sound like Tommy Pickles from Rugrats. It somehow alienated both fans of the comics and newcomers alike.</p><p data-characters=71 data-current-count=71 data-injectable=false>Reviews were not kind. Here’s Matt Brunson from Creative Loafing:</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>“Rachel Talalay’s hyper direction and Lori Petty’s hyper performance result in migraines; you also get an unrecognizable Ice-T as the most antagonistic of the Rippers and Iggy Pop in a fleeting cameo as a pervert with a penchant for 10-year-old girls.”</p><p data-characters=154 data-current-count=501 data-injectable=true>“Unrecognizable” is not the kind of recognition you want to get from critics. Here he is in action. He’s the one with the dangly earing.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=540 data-injectable=true>Weird that he was ignored by the academy for this role. Maybe they were on vacation that day. This is one of those movies that is so bad it’s worse. It made about $6 million on a $25 million budget, and honestly that seems like a lot.</p><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=156 data-injectable=false>Why would Marrow take such a role? Well, it’s not rocket science – he wanted the money. Marrow said he got a cool $1 million for taking on the role.</p><p data-characters=259 data-current-count=415 data-injectable=true>“My first real check was Tank Girl, with Lori Petty, playing a fuckin’ kangaroo,” he said on the Howard Stern Show. He was unsure he wanted to play a kangaroo, but once they offered him the money he said he started “hopping around the room.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=104 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=false>You hear that, MCU?
