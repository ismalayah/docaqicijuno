WowKwan (A.C.E)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=566 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=539 data-current-count=539 data-injectable=true>From calling each other their “best boy” to always being within arm’s reach of one another, members of the boy group A.C.E, Kim Sehyoon and Kim Byeongkwan, popularly known as Wow and BK/Kim, have earned themselves the K-pop ship name, WowKwan. The duo has gifted fans with many endearing and lovable moments, sharing their intimate friendship with the world. The pair are currently fulfilling their mandatory military service in South Korea, with Wow being discharged later this year, and BK to be discharged sometime next in 2023.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>9. HunHo (EXO)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=533 data-current-count=833 data-injectable=true>The title HunHo is derived from parts of the names of Sehun and Suho, two of the nine-member K-pop boy group EXO. What makes this bromance particularly heartwarming for many fans of the group is that the Suho is the leader of the group, while Sehun is the maknae, cementing a big brother-little brother dynamic worth rooting for. As one of the oldest members of the group, a now 31-year-old Suho took a now 27-year-old Sehun under his wing, but what has blossomed is an unbreakable, close bond and friendship between two teammates.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>8. JakeHoon (Enhypen)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=757 data-current-count=1057 data-injectable=true>Enhypen may be a relatively new boy group, but they are making serious waves in the K-pop space, and one of the reasons is the attention to the relationship between members Jake and Sunghoon. The pair have been very close long before their official idol debut and starred in the survival series I-Land as competitors. Though pit against each other to achieve idol status, both Jake and Sungoon maintained their noteworthy friendship and enjoyed each other’s company throughout the series’ run. From their adored handshake, to their public claims that they wish they were blood relations, these two are definitely best-friend goals. What’s more adorable is that they are in so in sync that they’ve been known to recognize each other when blindfolded.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>7.
