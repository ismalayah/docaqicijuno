It's up to their dad, Pod Clock (<a href=#>Jim Broadbent</a>), to rescue the kid with an emergency trip up the ice-cube chute--and when cubes come crashing down, they look like boulders.</p><p>The Lender family is in trouble. An aged aunt left them their house, but after her death, the will disappears, and an evil lawyer (<a href=#>John Goodman</a>) plans to destroy the house and build condos. But the Borrower kids get their hands on the will, and the lawyer comes after them with an exterminator.</p><p>The plot, and there's a lot more of it, is simply a way to lead us from one wonderfully imagined set to another. Like "The Incredible Shrinking Man'' (and Lily Tomlin's shrinking woman), the Clocks live in a world where everyday items look gargantuan: A birthday candle is big as a torch. Some of the effects also will remind you of "Honey, I Shrunk The Kids,'' but the charm comes in the way "The Borrowers'' makes its world look like a timeless story book. The Lenders' new neighborhood looks like a British factory town, for example, but the skyline is an (obvious) matte painting of a metropolis of the future.</p><p>The humor is physical. Goodman, as the lawyer, gets a face-full of insecticide, is nearly electrocuted and has all kinds of things bounce off his head. Little Peagreen Clock (<a href=#>Tom Felton</a>) has a harrowing time in a milk bottling plant (he's trapped in a bottle that's filled with milk and capped shut--a challenge for Houdini). Exterminator Jeff (Mark Williams) has a bloodhound that feeds on cheese and stinks up the place. And all of the Clocks face terrifying dangers, as when the kids fall out the bottom of a moving truck and are almost sucked into a vacuum cleaner.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lkqS%2Fs7vWnqmsZWFuhnk%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
