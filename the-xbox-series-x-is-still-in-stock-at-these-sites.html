Not only can you finally get your hands on the next-gen Xbox, but the elusive <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony PlayStation 5 has been much easier to nab</a> than at any point over the past two years.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=562 data-injectable=true>Between the two systems, these have given gamers headaches just to find them in stock. It’s been akin to buying hard-to-get concert tickets than gaming consoles. The low availability has resulted in mad dashes for the refresh key as potential buyers counted down the seconds on their browsers, hoping to get a crack at owning one.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false>Those opting for the brick-and-mortar route have found it nearly impossible to get their hands on either system.

Naturally, that caused a huge spike in demand, which we are still seeing two years after the initial launch dates for both consoles.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=89 data-current-count=89 data-injectable=false>All that being said, rejoice, gamers, because today could be your day if you act quickly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZoq6GdXa2vsMSMrJyroZWoerl5yKxkrKyZoblutc1mqq2nk6B6osCMrZ%2Beq5ViwKrAxKxm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
