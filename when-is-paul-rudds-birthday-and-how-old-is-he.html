His birthday is fast approaching, leading the actor ever closer to 53. His age hardly shows in the majority of Rudd’s releases, which include next year’s Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and last year’s Ghostbusters: Afterlife.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>When is Paul Rudd’s birthday?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Paul-Rudd-Family.jpg><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=525 data-injectable=true>Rudd is set to celebrate his 53rd birthday on April 6, 2022. The award-winning actor might even take a break from his busy schedule to celebrate his big day with his wife, Julie Yaeger, and their two children, Jack and Darby.</p><p data-characters=465 data-current-count=465 data-injectable=true>While many might assume that Rudd is as busy as his fellow Marvel compatriots, the only major project on the docket for him is the highly-anticipated third entry in the Ant-Man franchise, which is expected to arrive in theaters July 28, 2023. Only time will tell how much longer Rudd remains a fixture of the MCU, but given that he was instrumental in orchestrating the time heist in Avengers: Endgame, we’d put money on the fact that he’s here to stay.</p><p data-characters=43 data-current-count=43 data-injectable=false>In the meantime, Happy Birthday, Paul Rudd!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbHNZqCsZaCWwq150a6bnatdl7azwMedmLJlkaOxbrTOsGSopJRitrR5x55m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
