Of course if you go back even further than this you will find that Christianity actually co-opted the holiday from a Pagan festival, just as they did with Christmas as well. Well, if there is already a holiday there why not just hop on board?</p><p data-characters=462 data-current-count=462 data-injectable=true>So getting back on track, The Passion of the Christ follows the 12 hours leading to Christ’s death. Judas’ betrayal, the arrest of Jesus, the trial, Peter’s denial, the bearing of the cross, and of course, the death of Christ upon the cross. The cast consists of Jim Caviezel as Jesus Christ, Maia Morgenstern as Mary, Mother of Christ, and Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene, amongst other actors, predominantly Italian, playing the disciples.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mel-gibson-the-passion-of-the-christ.jpg><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=667 data-injectable=true>Many were unsure of what Gibson was trying to achieve when he set out to make this movie in which all the dialogue is either in Hebrew, Latin, or Aramaic.

It did however go on to become the fifth most popular film in 2004, grossing $612 million globally.</p><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=372 data-injectable=false>The film was nominated for three Academy Awards after its release: Best Cinematography, Best Original Score, and Best Makeup.
