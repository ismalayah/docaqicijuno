While there, she eventually encounters various other characters and events that assist her in unearthing various secrets. However, the actual filming took place in two locations, Barcelona and Tarragona, both of which are provinces of Spain.</p><p data-characters=272 data-current-count=620 data-injectable=true>The production proces,s including the photography for the film, initially began in May 2021, and continued for around nine weeks until July of the same year. Interestingly, certain unexpected locations were selected for filming some of the movie’s most important scenes.</p><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=true>For example, most of the interior scenes of the hospital were recorded in a former Mercedes-Benz factory in Barcelona’s Bon Pastor neighborhood. Reportedly, it took over <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">8,600 hours to build a 3,800 square meter set inside the factory</a>. However, Barcelona is not a new entrant as a major filming location, as the province housed several Hollywood blockbusters, such as The Machinist, The Bourne Identity, and Killing Eve, to name a few.</p><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false>The scenes outside the ward covered several climactic shots, such as Alice’s escape scene and the patients’ gathering outside the hospital following an outbreak of a fire. These scenes were filmed in an abandoned old Tobacco factory in Tarragona. Other locations include <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Castellar del Riu and the inland comune of Berguedà.</a> &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=271 data-current-count=602 data-injectable=true>The meticulous selection of the locations has managed to provide the plot with the beauty and strength that enabled it to achieve the outcome.
