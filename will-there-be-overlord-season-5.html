Late in July 2022, Maruyama revealed that his light novel series will end with its 18th volume."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Late in July 2022, Maruyama revealed that his light novel series will end with its 18th volume. The novel series is currently standing at 16 volumes, but the announcement has sealed the fate of its manga and anime adaptations.</p><p data-characters=424 data-current-count=424 data-injectable=true>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">anime</a> adaptation by Madhouse first aired between July 7 and Sept. 29, 2015, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">followed by three more seasons</a>. The fourth and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">most recent season concluded in Sept. 2022</a>, which adapted the light novel volumes 10, 11, and 14. Now where did volumes 12 and 13 go? A feature film adaptation of the Holy Kingdom Arc, titled Overlord: Holy Kingdom will soon hit the screens in 2024, and cover volumes 12 and 13 of the light novel.</p><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=342 data-injectable=false>Overlord: Holy Kingdom will serve as a canon sequel to Overlord anime season 4. However, it is also revealed that some elements of the original light novel will be omitted from the movie, meaning that it won’t be a 100% direct adaptation. With all that information, does Overlord season 5 seem likely? And do we have a release date yet?</p><h2 id=h-is-overlord-coming-back-with-season-5 data-injectable=false>Is Overlord coming back with season 5?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=642 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=430 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true>According to the latest updates, Overlord will first return with a film this year, adapting The Paladin of the Holy Kingdom Arc or volumes 12 and 13 of the light novel series. It will center on the demi-human invasion of the Roble Holy Kingdom, spearheaded by Jaldabaoth, who would then <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recruit Momon’s assistance</a> in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">their war effort</a>. So those merely looking forward to seeing Overlord again, you’re in luck this year.</p><p data-characters=395 data-current-count=395 data-injectable=false>That being said, Season 5 is a different conversation. As of now, Madhouse has not made a formal announcement endorsing or denouncing the release of Overlord season 5. This could be due to their preoccupation with the upcoming film. Given the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">positive reception that the first four seasons of the series have received on Crunchyroll</a>, it seems improbable that production will end before season 5.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=695 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=366 data-current-count=366 data-injectable=false>So, Overlord season 5 is very much possible, just not anytime soon. To support the speculation, Madhouse will have its hands on four light novel volumes to make season 5 as soon as the final two volumes of the novel series are released. Currently, there are only two already-released volumes to adapt into anime, and the production company might be waiting for more.</p><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=665 data-injectable=false>While nothing is set in stone yet, Overlord season 5 will likely come out sometime in 2025 or early 2026. There is no release date yet, but chances are that we will see the series conclude with at least one more season, unlike the many ill-fates series that are halted before a well-deserved finale.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6woKWkXam1pr7EZpmeZZ%2BrsrO4zqubZquVlsCwuoxuZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
